# Configuration

uMap runs with Django, so any Django setting should work, if you know what you
are doing.

The Django settings reference is here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/

Here are a few relevent settings for uMap.

## Usage

Those settings should either:

- be in `/etc/umap/umap.conf`, which uMap will try to load by default
- be in a random place on your server, which is then reference with the
  `UMAP_SETTINGS` env var
- be declared as env vars directly, for simple ones (string/boolean/list)

The hosts that uMap expects.
`ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['umap.mydomain.org']`

Can be set through env var too: `ALLOWED_HOSTS=umap.mydomain.org,u.mydomain.org`
